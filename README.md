Excel Dashboard Analysis

In this project, I used Excel pivot tables and slicers to create a dashboard that provides insights into Bike company's sales data. 
The dashboard includes several graphs and charts that highlight trends in sales by product, region, and salesperson.
To create the dashboard, I first analyzed the sales data in Excel using pivot tables and slicers. 
I then used this data to create several graphs and charts that visually represent the sales data. 
The dashboard is interactive, allowing users to filter the data by region, education, and martial status.
Overall, the dashboard provides a quick and easy way to analyze our company's sales data and identify areas for improvement.
